Allowed file types and maximum file size limit can be adjusted from the files in `constant` folder.
I used a metadata file under the `uploadedFiles` folder and store the metadata information of the files as plain text for the sake of simplicity. If you want to restore to defaults then you have to both delete the files that are uploaded in that folder and delete the **contents** of the *metadata* file.
